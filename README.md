<b>This app is deployed on Heroku. You can see it <a href="https://generatetimetable.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Here</a> (GenerateTimetable). </b>

This is the Activity Scheduling Ptoject which will generate the timetable for user with required inputs.

## Alogrithm
When first we started the project we chosed the Greedy algorithm to perform for our project but as days went by, we could not complete it in greedy way so the most suitable approach we reached, was <b>Randomized Brute Force</b> as some of the values generated in algorithm was random in order to fulfill the requirements. This algorithm is connected with the database in the back-end where the data saved in the database will be passed through the algorithm to generate the timetable. Our Algorithm on the console is just working perfectly but as we were learning the python and Django for the first time so that got us into the problem to connect the database with the algorithm but we are working on it untill we have time.

## Features
1. User-Friendly GUI which helps you upload data on the go.
2. You can generate timetable for one class at a time.
3. You can download the PDF file of the timetable.
4. A responsive app which can be used in any device.

## User Interface Change Request
When we are asked to make the user interface of your app in just few days, we made the interface as best as we can in that short time. But as we started working on project, our interface was not user friendly which was our first priority. So we imporved our version of this interface which is shown below to the version which you can watch now. We have tried our best to make the interface as friendly as we could. [Here](https://github.com/mrabdullahdev/CS311S20PID27/blob/master/Activity%20Scheduling%20-%20Final%20Project-compressed_2.pdf) you can see the old user-interface.
